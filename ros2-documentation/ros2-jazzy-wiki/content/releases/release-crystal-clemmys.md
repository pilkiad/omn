*Crystal Clemmys* is the third release of ROS 2.

<a id="supported-platforms"></a>

## Supported Platforms

Crystal Clemmys supports the following platforms according to [the platform support tiers](../project/platform-support-tiers.md):

Tier 1 platforms:

- Ubuntu 18.04 (Bionic)
- Mac macOS 10.12 (Sierra)
- Windows 10

Tier 2 platforms:

- Ubuntu 16.04 (Xenial)

Targeted platforms:

| Architecture | Ubuntu Bionic (18.04) | MacOS Sierra (10.12) | Windows 10 (VS2017) | Ubuntu Xenial (16.04) | Debian Stretch (9) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| amd64 | Tier 1 [d][a][s] | Tier 1 [a][s] | Tier 1 [a][s] | Tier 2 [s] | Tier 3 [s] |
| arm64 | Tier 1 [d][a][s] |  |  | Tier 2 [s] | Tier 3 [s] |

The following indicators show what delivery mechanisms are available for
each platform.

" [d] " Debian packages will be provided for this platform for
packages submitted to the rosdistro.

" [a] " Binary releases are provided as a single archive per
platform containing all packages in the Crystal ROS 2 repos file[^4].

" [s] " Compilation from source.

Middleware Implementation Support:

| Middleware Library | Middleware Provider | Support Level | Platforms | Architectures |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| rmw\_fastrtps\_cpp\* | eProsima Fast-RTPS | Tier 1 | All Platforms | All Architectures |
| rmw\_connext\_cpp | RTI Connext | Tier 1 | All Platforms except Debian | All Architectures except arm64 |
| rmw\_opensplice\_cpp | ADLINK OpenSplice | Tier 2 | All Platforms except Debian | All Architectures |

" \* " means default RMW implementation.

Middleware implementation support is dependent upon the platform support
tier. For example a Tier 1 middleware implementation on a Tier 2
platform can only receive Tier 2 support.

Minimum language requirements:

- C11[^5]
- C++14
- Python 3.5

Dependency Requirements:

|  | Required Support | | | | Recommended Support |

" \* " means that this is not the upstream version (available on the
official Operating System repositories) but a package distributed by
OSRF or the community (package built and distributed on custom
repositories).

" \*\* " Rolling distributions will see multiple version changes of
these dependencies during their lifetime.

" [s] " Compilation from source, the ROS buildfarm will not produce
any binary packages for these platforms.

This document only captures the version at the first release of a ROS
distribution and will not be updated as the dependencies move forward.
These versions are thus a low watermark.

Package manager use for dependencies:

- Ubuntu, Debian: apt
- MacOS: Homebrew, pip
- Windows: Chocolatey, pip

Build System Support:

- ament\_cmake
- cmake
- setuptools

<a id="changes-since-the-bouncy-release"></a>

## Changes since the Bouncy release

Changes since the [Bouncy Bolson](release-bouncy-bolson.md) release:

- geometry2 - `tf2_ros::Buffer` API Change

  `tf2_ros::Buffer` now uses `rclcpp::Time`, with the constructor requiring a `shared_ptr` to a `rclcpp::Clock` instance.
  See <https://github.com/ros2/geometry2/pull/67> for details, with example usage:

  ```
  #include <tf2_ros/transform_listener.h>
  #include <rclcpp/rclcpp.hpp>
  ...
  # Assuming you have a rclcpp::Node my_node
  tf2_ros::Buffer buffer(my_node.get_clock());
  tf2_ros::TransformListener tf_listener(buffer);
  ```
- All `rclcpp` and `rcutils` logging macros require semicolons.

  See <https://github.com/ros2/rcutils/issues/113> for details.
- `rcutils_get_error_string_safe()` and `rcl_get_error_string_safe()` have been replaced with `rcutils_get_error_string().str` and `rcl_get_error_string().str`.

  See <https://github.com/ros2/rcutils/pull/121> for details.
- rmw - `rmw_init` API Change

  There are two new structs, the `rcl_context_t` and the `rcl_init_options_t`, which are used with `rmw_init`.
  The init options struct is used to pass options down to the middleware and is an input to `rmw_init`.
  The context is a handle which is an output of `rmw_init` function is used to identify which init-shutdown cycle each entity is associated with, where an “entity” is anything created like a node, guard condition, etc.

  This is listed here because maintainers of alternative rmw implementations will need to implement these new functions to have their rmw implementation work in Crystal.

  This is the function that had a signature change:

  - [rmw\_init](https://github.com/ros2/rmw/blob/b7234243588a70fce105ea20b073f5ef6c1b685c/rmw/include/rmw/init.h#L54-L82)

  Additionally, there are these new functions which need to be implemented by each rmw implementation:

  - [rmw\_shutdown](https://github.com/ros2/rmw/blob/b7234243588a70fce105ea20b073f5ef6c1b685c/rmw/include/rmw/init.h#L84-L109)
  - [rmw\_init\_options\_init](https://github.com/ros2/rmw/blob/b7234243588a70fce105ea20b073f5ef6c1b685c/rmw/include/rmw/init_options.h#L62-L92)
  - [rmw\_init\_options\_copy](https://github.com/ros2/rmw/blob/b7234243588a70fce105ea20b073f5ef6c1b685c/rmw/include/rmw/init_options.h#L94-L128)
  - [rmw\_init\_options\_fini](https://github.com/ros2/rmw/blob/b7234243588a70fce105ea20b073f5ef6c1b685c/rmw/include/rmw/init_options.h#L130-L153)

  Here’s an example of what minimally needs to be changed in an rmw implementation to adhere to this API change:

  - [rmw\_fastrtps pr](https://github.com/ros2/rmw_fastrtps/pull/237/files)
- rcl - `rcl_init` API Change

  Like the `rmw` change above, there’s two new structs in `rcl` called `rcl_context_t` and `rcl_init_options_t`.
  The init options are passed into `rcl_init` as an input and the context is passed in as an output.
  The context is used to associate all other rcl entities to a specific init-shutdown cycle, effectively making init and shutdown no longer global functions, or rather those functions no longer use an global state and instead encapsulate all state within the context type.

  Any maintainers of a client library implementation (that also uses `rcl` under the hood) will need to make changes to work with Crystal.

  These functions were removed:

  - `rcl_get_global_arguments`
  - `rcl_get_instance_id`
  - `rcl_ok`

  These functions had signature changes:

  - [rcl\_init](https://github.com/ros2/rcl/blob/657d9e84c73e4268176efd163e96fda73c1a76d9/rcl/include/rcl/init.h#L30-L82)

  - [rcl\_guard\_condition\_init](https://github.com/ros2/rcl/blob/657d9e84c73e4268176efd163e96fda73c1a76d9/rcl/include/rcl/guard_condition.h#L54-L99)

  These new and changed functions will impact how you handle init and shutdown in your client library.
  For examples, look at the following `rclcpp` and `rclpy` PR’s:

  - [rclcpp](https://github.com/ros2/rclcpp/pull/587)
  - [rclpy](https://github.com/ros2/rclpy/pull/249)

  However, you may just continue to offer a single, global init and shutdown in your client library, and just store a single global context object.

## Known Issues

- A race condition in Fast-RTPS 1.7.0 may cause messages to drop under stress ([Issue](https://github.com/ros2/rmw_fastrtps/issues/258)).
- Using the TRANSIENT\_LOCAL QoS setting with rmw\_fastrtps\_cpp can crash applications with large messages ([Issue](https://github.com/ros2/rmw_fastrtps/issues/257)).
- Cross-vendor communication between rmw\_fastrtps\_cpp and other implementations is not functioning on Windows ([Issue](https://github.com/ros2/rmw_fastrtps/issues/246)).
- When using OpenSplice (version < 6.9.190227) on macOS and Windows you might experience naming conflicts when when referencing field types with names from other packages if the same name also exist in the current package ([Issue](https://github.com/ros2/rmw_opensplice/issues/259)).
  By updating to a newer OpenSplice version as well as at least the third patch release of Crystal the problem should be resolved.
  On Linux updating to the latest Debian packages will include the newest OpenSplice version.
