## Background

A quaternion is a 4-tuple representation of orientation, which is more concise than a rotation matrix.
Quaternions are very efficient for analyzing situations where rotations in three dimensions are involved.
Quaternions are used widely in robotics, quantum mechanics, computer vision, and 3D animation.

You can learn more about the underlying mathematical concept on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quaternion).
You can also take a look at an explorable video series [Visualizing quaternions](https://eater.net/quaternions) made by [3blue1brown](https://www.youtube.com/3blue1brown).

In this tutorial, you will learn how quaternions and conversion methods work in ROS 2.

<a id="prerequisites"></a>

## Prerequisites

You can take a look at libraries like [transforms3d](https://github.com/matthew-brett/transforms3d), [scipy.spatial.transform](https://github.com/scipy/scipy/tree/master/scipy/spatial/transform), [pytransform3d](https://github.com/rock-learning/pytransform3d), [numpy-quaternion](https://github.com/moble/quaternion) or [blender.mathutils](https://docs.blender.org/api/master/mathutils.html).

However, this is not a hard requirement and you can stick to any other geometric transformation library that suit you best.

<a id="components-of-a-quaternion"></a>

## Components of a quaternion

ROS 2 uses quaternions to track and apply rotations.
A quaternion has 4 components `(x, y, z, w)`.
In ROS 2, `w` is last, but in some libraries like Eigen, `w` can be placed at the first position.
The commonly-used unit quaternion that yields no rotation about the x/y/z axes is `(0, 0, 0, 1)`, and can be created in a following way:

```
#include <tf2/LinearMath/Quaternion.h>
...

tf2::Quaternion q;
// Create a quaternion from roll/pitch/yaw in radians (0, 0, 0)
q.setRPY(0, 0, 0);
// Print the quaternion components (0, 0, 0, 1)
RCLCPP_INFO(this->get_logger(), "%f %f %f %f",
            q.x(), q.y(), q.z(), q.w());
```

The magnitude of a quaternion should always be one.
If numerical errors cause a quaternion magnitude other than one, ROS 2 will print warnings.
To avoid these warnings, normalize the quaternion:

```
q.normalize();
```

<a id="quaternion-types-in-ros-2"></a>

## Quaternion types in ROS 2

ROS 2 uses two quaternion datatypes: `tf2::Quaternion` and its equivalent `geometry_msgs::msg::Quaternion`.
To convert between them in C++, use the methods of `tf2_geometry_msgs`.

```
#include <tf2_geometry_msgs/tf2_geometry_msgs.hpp>
...

tf2::Quaternion tf2_quat, tf2_quat_from_msg;
tf2_quat.setRPY(roll, pitch, yaw);
// Convert tf2::Quaternion to geometry_msgs::msg::Quaternion
geometry_msgs::msg::Quaternion msg_quat = tf2::toMsg(tf2_quat);

// Convert geometry_msgs::msg::Quaternion to tf2::Quaternion
tf2::convert(msg_quat, tf2_quat_from_msg);
// or
tf2::fromMsg(msg_quat, tf2_quat_from_msg);
```

There is no `tf2::Quaternion` equivalent in Python.
Instead, the builtin `list` is used.

```
from geometry_msgs.msg import Quaternion
...

# Create a list of floats, which is compatible with tf2
# Quaternion methods
quat_tf = [0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]

# Convert a list to geometry_msgs.msg.Quaternion
msg_quat = Quaternion(x=quat_tf[0], y=quat_tf[1], z=quat_tf[2], w=quat_tf[3])
```

## Quaternion operations

<a id="think-in-rpy-then-convert-to-quaternion"></a>

### 1 Think in RPY then convert to quaternion

It’s easy for us to think of rotations about axes, but hard to think in terms of quaternions.
A suggestion is to calculate target rotations in terms of the three individual rotations *roll* (about an X-axis), *pitch* (about the Y-axis), and *yaw* (about the Z-axis), and then convert to a quaternion.

```
# quaternion_from_euler method is available in turtle_tf2_py/turtle_tf2_py/turtle_tf2_broadcaster.py
q = quaternion_from_euler(1.5707, 0, -1.5707)
print(f'The quaternion representation is x: {q[0]} y: {q[1]} z: {q[2]} w: {q[3]}.')
```

This method relates to [Euler angles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler_angles).
There are several ways of applying Euler angles.
The one described above, which ROS 2 adopts, is called *fixed (or static) frame* RPY.
This means that the three individual rotations are applied to the original, unmoving coordinate axes.
This is contrary to *relative frame*, where rotations are applied to the coordinate axes that get transformed by preceding rotations.

<a id="applying-a-quaternion-rotation"></a>

### 2 Applying a quaternion rotation

To apply the rotation of one quaternion to a pose, simply multiply the previous quaternion of the pose by the quaternion representing the desired rotation.
The order of this multiplication matters.

C++

```
#include <tf2_geometry_msgs/tf2_geometry_msgs.hpp>
...

tf2::Quaternion q_orig, q_rot, q_new;

q_orig.setRPY(0.0, 0.0, 0.0);
// Rotate the previous pose by 180* about X
q_rot.setRPY(3.14159, 0.0, 0.0);
q_new = q_rot * q_orig;
q_new.normalize();
```

Python

```
q_orig = quaternion_from_euler(0, 0, 0)
# Rotate the previous pose by 180* about X
q_rot = quaternion_from_euler(3.14159, 0, 0)
q_new = quaternion_multiply(q_rot, q_orig)
```

<a id="inverting-a-quaternion"></a>

### 3 Inverting a quaternion

An easy way to invert a quaternion is to negate the x-, y-, and z-components:

```
q[0] = -q[0]
q[1] = -q[1]
q[2] = -q[2]
```

> [!NOTE]
>
> This should not be confused with negating *all* elements of the quaternion.

<a id="relative-rotations"></a>

### 4 Relative rotations

Say you have two quaternions from the same frame, `q_1` and `q_2`.
You want to find the relative rotation, `q_r`, that converts `q_1` to `q_2` in a following manner:

```
q_2 = q_r * q_1
```

You can solve for `q_r` similarly to solving a matrix equation.
Invert `q_1` and right-multiply both sides.
Again, the order of multiplication is important:

```
q_r = q_2 * q_1_inverse
```

Here’s an example to get the relative rotation from the previous robot pose to the current robot pose in python:

```
def quaternion_multiply(q0, q1):
    """
    Multiplies two quaternions.

    Input
    :param q0: A 4 element array containing the first quaternion (q01, q11, q21, q31)
    :param q1: A 4 element array containing the second quaternion (q02, q12, q22, q32)

    Output
    :return: A 4 element array containing the final quaternion (q03,q13,q23,q33) in (w, x, y, z) order

    """
    # Extract the values from q0
    x0 = q0[0]
    y0 = q0[1]
    z0 = q0[2]
    w0 = q0[3]

    # Extract the values from q1
    x1 = q1[0]
    y1 = q1[1]
    z1 = q1[2]
    w1 = q1[3]

    # Compute the product of the two quaternions, term by term
    q0q1_w = w0 * w1 - x0 * x1 - y0 * y1 - z0 * z1
    q0q1_x = w0 * x1 + x0 * w1 + y0 * z1 - z0 * y1
    q0q1_y = w0 * y1 - x0 * z1 + y0 * w1 + z0 * x1
    q0q1_z = w0 * z1 + x0 * y1 - y0 * x1 + z0 * w1

    # Create a 4 element array containing the final quaternion
    final_quaternion = np.array([q0q1_w, q0q1_x, q0q1_y, q0q1_z])

    # Return a 4 element array containing the final quaternion (q02,q12,q22,q32)
    return final_quaternion

q1_inv[0] = -prev_pose.pose.orientation.x   # Negate for inverse
q1_inv[1] = -prev_pose.pose.orientation.y   # Negate for inverse
q1_inv[2] = -prev_pose.pose.orientation.z   # Negate for inverse
q1_inv[3] = prev_pose.pose.orientation.w

q2[0] = current_pose.pose.orientation.x
q2[1] = current_pose.pose.orientation.y
q2[2] = current_pose.pose.orientation.z
q2[3] = current_pose.pose.orientation.w

qr = quaternion_multiply(q2, q1_inv)
```
