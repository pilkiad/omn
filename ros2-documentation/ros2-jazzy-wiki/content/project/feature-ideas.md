# Feature Ideas

Table of Contents

- [Design / Concept](#design-concept)
- [Infrastructure and tools](#infrastructure-and-tools)
- [New features](#new-features)
- [Reducing Technical Debt](#reducing-technical-debt)

The following are feature ideas in no specific order.
This list contains features that we think are important and can make for good contributions to ROS 2.
[Please get in touch with us](../reference/contact.md) before digging into a new feature.
We can offer guidance, and connect you with other developers.

<a id="design-concept"></a>

## Design / Concept

- IDL format

  - Leverage new features like grouping constants into enums
  - Extend usage to `.idl` files with just constants and/or declare parameters with ranges
  - Revisit constraints of IDL interface naming, see [ros2/design#220](https://github.com/ros2/design/pull/220)
- Create migration plan for ROS 1 -> ROS 2 transition
- Uniqueness of node names, see [ros2/design#187](https://github.com/ros2/design/issues/187)
- Specific “API” of a node in terms of topics / services / etc. in a descriptive format, see [ros2/design#266](https://github.com/ros2/design/pull/266)

## Infrastructure and tools

- Building

  - Consolidate <https://build.ros2.org> and <https://ci.ros2.org>
  - Provision macOS
  - Windows and macOS packages
  - Support profiles in `colcon`
- Documentation

  - Deprecate <https://design.ros2.org>.
    Content should move to either an REP, to <https://github.com/ros2/ros2_documentation>, or be removed.
  - Fix per-package documentation builder to be able to document build artifacts, i.e. messages, services, actions, etc.
  - Make <https://docs.ros.org/en/ros2_documentation> automatically rebuild on changes to <https://github.com/ros2/ros2_documentation>.
  - `ament` documentation
  - Add documentation examples of using ROS 2 with Jupyter notebooks.
  - Add documentation for implementing a new RMW.
  - Provide three different kinds of content:

    - “demos” to show features and cover them with tests
    - “examples” to show a simple/minimalistic usage which might have multiple ways to do something
    - “tutorials” which contain more comments and anchors for the wiki (teaching one recommended way)

## New features

The trailing stars indicate the rough effort: 1 star for small, 2 stars for medium, 3 stars for large.

- Logging improvements [\* / \*\*]

  - Configuration specified in a file
  - Per-logger configuration (enabling e.g. `rqt_logger_level`)
- Time related

  - Support rate and sleep based on clock
- Additional Graph API features [\*\* / \*\*\*]

  - Introspect QoS setting for all (especially remote) topics
  - a la ROS 1 Master API: <https://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Master_API>
  - Event-based notification
  - Requires knowledge of the rmw interface which needs to be extended
- Executor

  - Performance improvements (mostly around the waitset)
  - Deterministic ordering (fair scheduling)
  - Decouple waitables
- Message generation

  - Catch-up message generation for languages not supported out-of-the-box
  - Mangle field names in message to avoid language specific keywords
  - Improve generator performance by running them in the same Python interpreter
- Launch

  - Support for launching multi-node executables (i.e. manual composition)
  - Extend launch XML/YAML support: events and event handlers, tag namespaces and aliasing
- Rosbag

  - Support recording services (and actions)
- ros1\_bridge

  - Support bridging actions
- RMW configuration

  - Unified standard way of configuring the middleware
- Remapping [\*\* / \*\*\*]

  - Dynamic remapping and aliasing through a Service interface
- Type masquerading [\*\*\*]

  - a la ROS 1’s message traits: <https://wiki.ros.org/roscpp/Overview/MessagesSerializationAndAdaptingTypes>
  - Requires knowledge of the typesupport system
- Expand on real-time safety [\*\*\*]

  - For services, clients, and parameters
  - Expose more quality of service parameters related to real-time performance
  - Real-time-safe intra-process messaging
- Multi-robot supporting features and demos [\*\*\*]

  - Undesired that all nodes across all robots share the same domain (and discover each other)
  - Design how to “partition” the system
- Support more DDS / RTPS implementations:

  - RTI Connext DDS Micro (implemented, not enabled by default or officially supported).
- Security improvements:

  - More granularity in security configuration (allow authentication only, authentication and encryption, etc.) [\*]
  - Integrate DDS-Security logging plugin (unified way to aggregate security events and report them to the users through a ROS interface) [\*\*]
  - Key storage security (right now, keys are just stored in the filesystem) [\*\*]
  - More user friendly interface (make it easier to specify security config).
    Maybe a Qt GUI?
    This GUI could also assist in distributing keys somehow [\*\*\*]
  - A way to say “please secure this running system” with some UI that would auto-generate keys and policies for everything that is currently running [\*\*\*]
  - If there are hardware-specific features for securing keys or accelerating encryption/signing messages, that could be interesting to add to DDS/RTPS implementations that don’t use it already [\*\*\*]

## Reducing Technical Debt

- Fix flaky tests on <https://ci.ros2.org/view/nightly>.
- Ability to run (all) unit tests with tools e.g. valgrind, clang-tidy, clang static analysis (scan-build), ASAN, TSAN, UBSAN, etc.
- API review, specifically user-facing APIs in rclcpp and rclpy
- Refactor the rclcpp API into separate packages focused on a single aspect, rclcpp should afterward still provide the combined user-facing API
- Revisit message allocators, consider using std::polymorphic\_allocator to address problems
- Synchronize / reconcile [design docs](https://design.ros2.org) with the implementation.
- Address / classify pending tickets
- Address TODOs in code / docs
- Remove tinyxml as a dependency
