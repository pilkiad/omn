This page explains the recommended method of hosting your release repositories on [ros2-gbp](https://github.com/ros2-gbp).

## What is ROS 2 GBP?

[ros2-gbp](https://github.com/ros2-gbp) is a GitHub organization that hosts the release repositories for ROS packages.
It also maintains a list of release teams, the list of members per release team and the list of release repositories maintained by the release teams in <https://github.com/ros2-gbp/ros2-gbp-github-org>.
Interactions with ros2-gbp-github-org are done through raising GitHub issues.
It is recommended that you request to join a release team and set up a release repository early as it can take some time for the ros2-gbp maintainers to respond to your requests.

## What is a release team?

A release team is a [GitHub team](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/organizing-members-into-teams/about-teams) that consists of a group of people who are responsible for the release process of one or more repositories.
Release teams are often made up of an organization, a working group, or even an individual, and are named after the team or group that they represent.
The list of release teams and their associated release repositories are maintained at [ros2-gbp-github-org](https://github.com/ros2-gbp/ros2-gbp-github-org).

**You must be a part of the release team that you are planning on releasing the project for.**
If you intend to release the repository under an existing team, follow [Join a release team](#join-a-release-team).
If you intend to start a new team, follow [Start a new release team](#start-a-new-release-team).

### Join a release team

Fill the [Update Release Team Membership issue](https://github.com/ros2-gbp/ros2-gbp-github-org/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=update_release_team_membership.md&title=Update+release+team+membership) issue template
if a release team already exists for your project but you are not part of it.

<a id="id4"></a>

### Start a new release team

If no release team exists for your project yet, fill out the [New Release Team issue](https://github.com/ros2-gbp/ros2-gbp-github-org/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=new_release_team.md&title=Add+release+team) issue template to request one be created.

## What is a release repository?

A release repository is a repository that

- stores files generated from the release process, for the ROS buildfarm to use
- caches configurations from the release process to simplify subsequent releases of the repository in the future

Having a release repository separate from your source code repository is a requirement for making a release in ROS 2.

<a id="id6"></a>

### Create a new release repository

If your repository is new to the ROS community, you should first open a pull request on [ros/rosdistro](https://github.com/ros/rosdistro) adding a `source` entry for your repository (e.g. <https://github.com/ros/rosdistro/pull/39513>).
The review process for the rosdistro database will ensure your repository and packages conform to the [REP 144 package naming conventions](https://reps.openrobotics.org/rep-0144/) and other requirements before release.
Once your package name has been approved and merged, fill in the [Add New Release Repositories issue](https://github.com/ros2-gbp/ros2-gbp-github-org/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=new_release_repository.md&title=Add+new+release+repositories) issue template
if you don’t have a release repo for your project yet.

## What if my existing release repo isn’t on ros2-gbp?

Packages released before ros2-gbp existed may have their release repositories hosted elsewhere.
It is now strongly recommended for release repositories to live in this dedicated GitHub organization.
If you are porting a ROS 1 package to ROS 2 and planning on releasing your packages into ROS 2 for the first time, follow standard procedure to request for a new release repository for your ROS 2 releases.
If you have previously released your packages for ROS 2, when raising the [Add New Release Repositories issue](https://github.com/ros2-gbp/ros2-gbp-github-org/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=new_release_repository.md&title=Add+new+release+repositories), **specify your current release repository url**, and follow standard procedure for the rest.

> [!NOTE]
>
> **When releasing your packages into the Rolling distribution, you must use a release repository hosted in the ros2-gbp organization**.
> Release repositories hosted elsewhere are still supported for stable distributions if you are not planning to release the repository into Rolling.
> Since stable distributions created from Rolling will start with release repositories in the ros2-gbp organization it is recommend that you use the ros2-gbp release repositories for all ROS 2 distributions to avoid fragmenting the release information.
>
> A ros2-gbp release repository may become a hard requirement for all distros in the future and maintaining a single release repository for all ROS 2 distributions simplifies the maintenance of releases for both the Rolling distribution maintainers and package maintainers.
